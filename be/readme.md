## Project Structure

The project follows the following directory structure:

```
/src
/src/controllers # Contains route handlers
/src/models # Sequelize models and database relations
/src/utils # Utilities and shared resources
/src/middleware # Middleware for route protection
/src/types # TypeScript interfaces
/src/config # Environment configuration
/__tests__ # Unit tests
/migrations # Sequelize migrations
/seeders # Sequelize seeders
```

## Getting Started

### Installation


1. Install dependencies:
`yarn install`
2. Running: 
`docker compose up -d`
`yarn prepare:prod`
`yarn start`
3. Tests: 
`docker compose up -d`
`yarn test`

# Environment Configuration
Create environment files for production and testing:

`.env.prod` for production environment configuration.
`.env.test` for testing environment configuration.
Example `.env.prod` content:

```
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
MYSQL_DATABASE=database
MYSQL_USER=user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=password
MYSQL_PORT=3316

JWT_SECRET=blahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlah
NODE_ENV=prod
PORT=3000
```

Example `.env.test` content:

```
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
MYSQL_DATABASE=database
MYSQL_USER=user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=password
MYSQL_PORT=3317

JWT_SECRET=blahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlahBlah
NODE_ENV=test
PORT=3001
```


# Commands
- yarn prepare:prod - Flush, migrate, and seed the production database.
- yarn prepare:test - Flush, migrate, and seed the test database.
- yarn migrate:test - Migrate the test database.
- yarn seed:test - Seed the test database.
- yarn pretest - Flush and synchronize the test database.
- yarn flushdb:test - Flush and recreate the test database.
- yarn flushdb:prod - Flush and recreate the production database.
- yarn test - Run all tests.
- yarn undo:seed - Undo seed in production.
- yarn undo:migration - Undo migration in production.
- yarn undo:seed:test - Undo seed in test.
- yarn undo:migrate:test - Undo migration in test.
- yarn migrate:test:status - View migration status for test.
- yarn migrate:prod:status - View migration status for production.
- yarn start - Launch the Express server.


# Routes
See the API [Documentation](/api_docs) for detailed information about each route, request payloads, responses, and authentication requirements.

## Tech stack

- redis
- swagger
- express.js
- sequelize
- docker
- jwt
- jest / ts-jest
- node / ts-node
- supertest
- tsconfig
- prettier
- yarn
- dotenv


### API:

#### Auth

- /user/login <-- username, password
  - returns token to be used for secure requests
- /user/register <-- username, password
  - returns token to be used for secure requests

#### Tasks

- GET /tasks/ <-- all tasks\*
- GET /tasks/:id <-- specific task\*
- POST /tasks/ <-- create task
- DELETE /tasks/:id <-- delete task
- PUT /tasks/:id <-- update task

`*` = Redis Enabled

### how to test

`yarn test` on `<root>`

### how is the test performed

- test database is migrated and seeded before tests
- test is ran against http requests for both auth and task routes
- the task route keep track and verify the session on each test
- the database and redis is flushed upon test end
- the environment is dictated by dotenv

### how is docker setup-ed

- we have two databases
  - these databases are read by `.env` files
  - test database is only used and flushed during tests
  - prod database is preserved and not flushed until user operation

### how is dotenv setup-ed

- we are using `dotenv-cli`
- we have `.env.test` `.env.prod` `.env` files
  - `.env` files is used `docker-compose.yml` as it is higher level and global
  - `.env.test` and `.env-prod` is hand-picked against the `NODE_ENV` or `package.scripts` so we are served these environment for ideal development playground

### how is migration & seed setup-id

- we have `migration` and `seed` inside the `backend`
  - you can refer to `package.scripts` to see possible operations we can run
  - to run migration we can do `yarn migrate` or `yarn migrate:test` or `yarn preparedb:prod` or `yarn preparedb:test`
  - to run seed we can do `yarn seed` or `yarn seed:test` or `yarn preparedb:prod` or `yarn preparedb:test` 
  - to undo migration we can do `yarn undo:migrate`
  - to undo seed we can do `yarn undo:seed`


# Docker 
 to run you can install via `docker-compose up -d` 
 it will install the following
 - mysql:5 for testing and production use
 - redis 

 you can unmount/stop/down the docker services via 
 `docker-compose down --remove-orphans` 

you can make use of `Dockerfile` to build the while app to deploy/host/execute as portable. 
or simply run `yarn start`
